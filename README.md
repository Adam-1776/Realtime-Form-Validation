# Form Validation in Real Time

Simple demonstration of how forms can be validate in real time using javascript. <br>
I use event listeners to check the validity of each input field dynamically, and enable the submit button when all have been validated. <br>
Error messages are printed above the submit button if any field was not able to validated.
